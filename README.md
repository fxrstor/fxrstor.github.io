# fxrstor's blog
Hi. This is my blog. The code quality isn't amazing but it works (roughly two-fourths of it's pasted from stack overflow and other websites). I've used slight AI in it as well. If you notice any issues, please do not hesitate to open an issue. If you would like to save some of my time, then do the respective changes and submit a PR :)

### future ideas (for myself)
1. Jinjector - injecting code to minecraft mod (jar files)
2. writing a bootkit
3. investigate tModLoader's remote code execution fuss
4. LSTAR/syscall hook
5. Ledger and Trezor MITM attacks via hooking
6. Exodus and Atomic wallet decryption and ASAR code injection
